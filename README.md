## Data retrieving
The data is in the repository COVID-19 forked from JHU repo: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

To keep the databse automatically updated, I installed this [great app](https://github.com/wei/pull) that automatically pull newest version from the master repo.

I also incorporate data from other sources (e.g. GDP and population from https://data.worldbank.org/) to get more insight from the COVID-19 data.

## Exploratory data analysis
Please see *EDA_global.ipynb* for code and results.
